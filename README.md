# MyReads

This is a simple book app to keep my virtual library up to date. The application uses Goole Books API to do a search. You will be able to add those books to your bookshelve (it could be 'Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Read').

## Install

yarn:

    $ yarn install

    $ yarn add react@next react-dom@next
